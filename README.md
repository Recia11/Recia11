I currently work in data consulting, where I have developed a love for programming in Clojure. My background is diverse from engineering design to data analysis to project management. I have worked with various BI tools such as Tableau, Sisense, and Periscope and have also developed my own tools to automate ETL processes. 

I really love solving complex problems. I like to comprehend a situation by breaking it down into its components, identify underlying issues by asking probing questions, and understand the big picture to find an effective solution.
